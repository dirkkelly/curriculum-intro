Mirror, Mirror on the Wall

We'll be making a magic mirror that responds to us as we do our morning routine.  The mirror will respond to whatever question you ask it with "Yes".

```
ask mirror: will it rain today
Yes
```
But, if you ask the mirror the below questions you should get the following response:

```
ask mirror: what time is it
Time to code your face off
---
ask mirror: how was breakfast
everything goes better with code
---
ask mirror: do I have my phone
yes, I have the new iphone <random number> hotness
---
ask mirror: code time?
heck yea, stop talking to me and get coding. #=> loop should break
```

We want to run this in a loop, so all of our code should go between

```
while true

 <all your beautiful code here>

end
```
