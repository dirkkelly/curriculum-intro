#Mirror, Mirror on the Wall

We'll be making a magic mirror that responds to us as we do our morning routine.  The mirror will respond to whatever question you ask it with "Yes". The program should end when we ask the mirror: "time to code?"

```
ask mirror: will it rain today?
Yes
```
But, if you ask the mirror the below questions you should get the following response:

```
ask mirror: what time is it?
Time to code your face off
---
ask mirror: how was breakfast?
everything goes better with code
---
ask mirror: do I have my phone?
yes, I have the new iphone <random number> hotness
---
ask mirror: time to code?
heck yea, stop talking to me and get coding. #=> loop should break
```

We want to run this in a loop, so all of our code should go between

```
while true

 <all your beautiful code here>

end
```
