#Personal Hype Man

Everybody could use a pick me up from time to time.  Your computer is your new hype man.

####How the Program Should Work
The computer should offer the following prompt: I think I am: 
You should then type in any adjective that can have the 'est' suffix added to it. (strong, stronger, strongest)
Your computer should respond by saying: No, you're the <adj> + 'est' suffix.

**Example**
```
> I think I am: cool
> No, you're the COOLEST!
```
**Example words to try:** smart, fast, nice, tall, strong etc...

####Extension 1
Have your program first ask for your name.  Then have it add your name to the response.
```
> What's your name? Michael
> I think I am: cool
> No, Michael, you're the COOLEST!
```

####Extension 2
Wrap your program in a loop so that it keeps prompting you for your input.  It should only ask for your name once and when you type 'quit' the program should respond with `Hope you're feeling pumped!` and then end. 
```
> What's your name? Michael
> I think I am: cool
> No, Michael, you're the COOLEST!

> I think I am: smart
> No, Michael, you're the SMARTEST!

> I think I am: quit
> Hope you're feeling pumped! 

...end of program
```
