#Command and Conquer
**Learning Goal:** Understand paths, file creation, viewing, and deleting

**Task:** Dominate the command line like you were born to

* Create a new directory called `codelater`

####Oops! You realize it needs to be called `code`

* Move up a directory and delete `codelater`
* Make a new directory properly named `code`
* Create a new file inside `code` called `hello world.rb`

####Oops! We should really not name files with spaces, use underscores instead

* Rename the file `hello world.rb` to `hello_world.rb`
* Open `hello_world.rb` with Sublime Text 
* Write `puts "Hello World"` and save the file
* Run the file so that "Hello World" shows up in command line
* Open `IRB` and load the file
